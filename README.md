AnyPS5 Studio is an all-in-one desktop launcher, management interface, and static binary relinker for running decrypted PlayStation 5 executables natively on **Windows x64** and **Linux x64**.

Unlike traditional virtual-machine emulators, AnyPS5 operates via **static binary relinking**. The PlayStation 5 executable (ELF) is analyzed, translated at the machine instruction level, and converted directly into native host executables (`.exe` on Windows, native ELF `.elf` on Linux). Games execute directly on your host CPU and GPU through clean-room high-level emulation (HLE) system libraries and native Vulkan / DirectX 12 rendering pipelines.

## Key Features

### PlayStation 5 Styled Interface
- Console-grade user experience featuring dark aesthetic, fluid navigation, cover artwork presentation, and audio feedback.
- Modern frameless desktop window design with native window dragging, double-click to maximize, and integrated window controls.
- Real-time gamepad integration with DualSense wireless controller status and input mapping.

### Dual-Mode Relinker Studio
- **Simple Mode**: A streamlined workflow designed for non-technical users. Displays cover art, verifies system readiness, automatically configures optimal instruction lowering, and starts relinking with a single click.
- **Advanced Mode**: Full technical controls for developers and power users, including target OS (Windows vs. Linux), subsystem flags (GUI vs. Console), CPU codegen lowering (AMD Zen2 native, Intel AVX2, Rosetta 2), and import dead-code pruning.
- **Safe Relinker Defaults**: Configured to preserve all non-PLT import relocations, dynamic C++ virtual method tables, RTTI structures, and standard error categories, eliminating runtime `0xC0000005` access violation crashes.
- **Automated Middleware Discovery**: Automatically scans game directories and subdirectories to locate, unwrap, and convert guest middleware PRXs (such as `libcohtml`, `libfmod`, and `MediaDecoders`).

### State-Driven Game Launcher
- Integrated launch monitor that tracks real child process events and startup progression without exposing raw developer clutter.
- Active session playtime tracking with live telemetry.
- Intelligent process exit diagnostics that distinguish between clean exits, user stops, and crashes, providing clear remedies when an error occurs.
- Collapsible Technical Details drawer with color-coded standard output and PRX logs, accompanied by a 1-click diagnostic report exporter.

### Automatic Background Updates
- Native integration with GitHub Releases. AnyPS5 Studio automatically checks for application updates, updated relinker engines, and newly stubbed clean-room system libraries in the background.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Windows
1. Download `AnyPS5-Studio-Setup-1.4.7.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/ramsforge/AnyPS5-Studio/releases) page.
2. Run the 1-click silent installer to install AnyPS5 Studio. The installer automatically provisions the static relinker engine (`relinker.exe`), clean-room PlayStation 5 system libraries (`libs/`), and graphics translation DLLs without administrative UAC prompts.

#### Linux

AnyPS5 Studio is distributed as a standalone 64-bit AppImage (`AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage`). It bundles the native static relinker, system PRX libraries, and Vulkan runtime layers.

##### 1. Prerequisite: Install FUSE 2 Library
AppImage packages use FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to mount and execute. Modern Linux distributions (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Debian 12+, Fedora, Arch Linux) default to FUSE 3 and do not include the legacy FUSE 2 library by default.

Without this package, launching the AppImage will produce the following error:
```
dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Install FUSE 2 for your distribution:

- **Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Debian 12+**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y libfuse2
  ```
  *(Note: On Ubuntu 24.04 and newer Debian distributions, the package may also be installed as `libfuse2t64`)*

- **Fedora, RHEL, CentOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install -y fuse-libs
  ```

- **Arch Linux, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S --needed fuse2
  ```

- **openSUSE (Tumbleweed / Leap)**:
  ```bash
  sudo zypper install -y libfuse2
  ```

##### 2. Download and Mark Executable
1. Download the latest `AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ramsforge/AnyPS5-Studio/releases).
2. Open a terminal in the folder containing the downloaded file (e.g. `cd ~/Downloads`).
3. Make the AppImage executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage
   ```

##### 3. Launch the Studio
Run the AppImage from your terminal:
```bash
./AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage
```
Or double-click the file in your desktop file manager (GNOME Files, Dolphin, Thunar).

##### 4. Optional Desktop Integration
For seamless desktop menu integration with your application launcher:
- You can install [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) to integrate downloaded AppImages with a single click.
- Or place the AppImage in your user binary path:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
  mv AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage ~/.local/bin/anyps5-studio
  ```

##### 5. Fallback for Restricted Environments (Docker, WSL2, Sandboxes)
If you are running in an environment where FUSE mounting is disallowed or restricted, you can run AnyPS5 Studio directly by extracting the AppImage contents:
```bash
./AnyPS5-Studio-1.4.7.AppImage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/anyps5-ui
```

### Usage
1. Launch **AnyPS5 Studio**.
2. Click **Import PS5 Title** to import an individual game folder or switch to **Scan Directory** to recursively discover and batch-import multiple PlayStation 5 titles from a parent folder.
3. Select your game and click **Relink** (or navigate to **Relinker Studio**).
4. Review the automatically selected configuration and click **Start Relinking Process**.
5. Once conversion completes, click **Play Game** to launch the ported executable natively on your system.

## Technical Architecture

AnyPS5 operates across three primary layers:

1. **Relinker Core**: Parses decrypted PlayStation 5 ELF binaries, reconstructs program headers and sections, lowers AMD Zen2 instructions into Intel AVX2 equivalents when necessary, and produces a native 64-bit Windows PE (`app.exe`) or native Linux ELF (`app.elf`).
2. **Clean-Room System Libraries (`libs/`)**: High-level reimplementations of PlayStation system modules (`libkernel.prx`, `libScePad.prx`, `libSceAudioOut.prx`, `libSceSaveData.prx`, `libSceVideoOut.prx`, `libSceAgc.prx`, etc.) compiled as native dynamic libraries.
3. **Graphics & Shaders**: PS5 AGC shader bytecode is translated to standard SPIR-V via the built-in shader recompiler, targeting modern DirectX 12 and Vulkan rendering pipelines.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit) or Linux (x86-64 glibc 2.31+, e.g. Ubuntu 22.04+, Arch Linux, CachyOS, Fedora 38+).
- **Processor**: x86-64 CPU supporting AVX2 instructions (Intel 4th Generation Core or newer, AMD Ryzen series).
- **Graphics Card**: GPU with Vulkan 1.3 or DirectX 12 driver support (NVIDIA GeForce, AMD Radeon, or Intel Arc).
- **Memory**: 16 GB RAM recommended.
- **Game Files**: Decrypted PlayStation 5 software dump obtained legally from your own hardware.
